    "\n",
    "We will soon be launching a SaaS version of the software.  It will allow you to take advantage of the above functionality without participating in the decentralized fund.  Your features & algorithms will be sent to a version of the AI that only looks at your fund's features and algorithms but still ranks & evaluates them for overfit in real time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, you can use the SaaS version to collaborate with other funds without revealing IP to one another.  We believe this type of collaboration is novel and has significant implications for the industry - allowing a small set of funds to match the capacities of the largest systematic funds.       \n",

    "There are **three preliminary steps:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Authenticate & Setup the Workspace.\n",
    "2.  Configure the parameters of the historical data you would like to call, and the parameters of the series you are studying - for instance, the BTC-USD volatility series at 45 minute intervals.\n",
    "3.  Call, Organize & Clean the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps are broken out by their underlying functions in the longer tutorial.  Here, wrapper functions shorten about 30 lines of code to one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Step four is where you will spend 95% of your time:  Here you will **do your data exploration and feature engineering**.  There are then **three final steps:** \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Submit your historical data.  This historical data submission will cover a time period from the beginning of a specified date - e.g. the 4 hr alpha test series begins on July  2019 - and continue up to the present moment.\n",
    "6.  Schedule the cron job to submit live features.\n",
    "7.  (Optional) Embed the data tools from your dashboard into the same notebook, writing up your findings to create live, interactive research tools and/or market signals. \n",
